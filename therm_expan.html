                href="http://www.explainthatstuff.com/water.html">Water
                is a unique
                material</a> in many ways.&nbsp; Without it and its <a

                moz-do-not-send="true">unusual properties</a>
              life as we know it could not exist.&nbsp; One of these
              critical
              properties is the so-called anomalous expansion.&nbsp;
              When heated,
              most substances expand according to the simple description
              above, but
              when heated through the temperature range 0 - 4<sup> 0</sup>C
              water
              contracts (its density increases).<br>

              <br>
              Furthermore, as you are probably aware, when water is
              cooled and
              freezes (at 0 <sup>0</sup>C) the frozen water (ice)
              expands becoming
              less dense, causing problems with roads, buildings
              etc.&nbsp; This
              property is very unusual, most substances, on freezing
              contract rather
              than expand.&nbsp; This property of water explains why ice
              floats.&nbsp; If this were not the case, the ice created
              in the winter
              would sink to the bottom of lakes and oceans and would be
              insulated
              from melting in the summer.&nbsp; After a short time our
              oceans and
              lakes would consist of a solid mass of ice with only a
              thin layer at
              the surface alternately freezing and melting as the
              seasons came and
              went - hardly conducive to the development of life.<br>

        difference between a physicist, an engineer, and a
        mathematician?<br>
        If an engineer walks into a room and sees a fire in the middle
        and a
        bucket of water in the corner, he takes the bucket of water and
        pours
        it on the fire and puts it out.<br>
        If a physicist walks into a room and sees a fire in the middle
        and a

        pours
        it eloquently around the fire and lets the fire put itself out.<br>
        If a mathematician walks into a room and sees a fire in the
        middle and
        a bucket of water in the corner, he convinces himself there is a
        solution and leaves.<br>
