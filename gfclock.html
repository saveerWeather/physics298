<b><u><font face="Arial"><font color="#FF0000"><font size=+2>How The Grandfather
Clock Got Its Name</font></font></font></u></b></h3></center>

<p><br><font face="Arial">Over 100 years ago in Piercebridge, North Yorkshire,
England, there was a charming traveler's haven known as the George Hotel.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">The hotel was a routine stop for horse coaches and
was managed by two bachelor brothers named Jenkins.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">In the lobby stood a floor clock, as they were called
back in those days, that had been there for many years. One unusual characteristic
on the old clock was that it kept very good time. This was uncommon, since
in those days clocks were generally not noted for their accuracy.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">One day, one of the brothers died and suddenly the
old clock started losing time. At first it lost 15 minutes per day but
when several clocksmiths gave up trying to repair the ailing timepiece,
it was losing more than an hour each day.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">The clocks incurable problem became as talked about
as its precision had been. Some said it was no surprise that, though fully
wound, the old clock stopped when the surviving brother died at the age
of ninety.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">The new manager of the hotel never attempted to have
it repaired. He just left it standing in a sunlit corner of the lobby,
its hands resting in the position they assumed the moment the last Jenkins
brother died.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">About 1875, an American songwriter named Henry Clay
Work happened to be staying at the George Hotel during a trip to England.
He was told the story of the old clock and after seeing the clock for himself,
decided to compose a song about the fascinating coincidence that the clock
stopped forever the moment its elder owner passed away. Henry came back
to America and published the lyrics that sold over a million copies of
sheet music.</font><font face="Arial"></font>
<center>
<p><font face="Arial">Until that time, clocks such as the one in the old
George Hotel were referred to by a variety of names, but not before Henry
Work wrote his song, over a hundred years ago, were they referred to as
grandfather clocks.</font><br>

<p><br><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>My grandfather's clock was too
tall for the shelf</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>So it stood ninety years on the floor</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>It was taller by half than the old
man himself</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>But it weighed not a pennyweight more</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>It was bought on the morn on the day
that he was born</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>It was always his treasure and pride</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>But it stopped, short, never to go
again</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>When the old man died</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>Ninety years without slumbering</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>Tic toc tic toc</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>His life's seconds numbering</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>Tic toc tic toc</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>It stopped, short, never to go again</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>When the old man died.</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>In watching its pendulum swing to
and fro</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>Many hours he had spent when a boy</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>And through childhood and manhood,
the clock seemed to know</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>And to share both his grief and his
joy</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>For it struck 24 when he entered at
the door</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>With a blooming and beautiful bride,</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>But it stopped, short, never to go
again</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>When the old man died</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>CHORUS</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>My grandfather said that of those he
could hire</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>Not a servant so faithful he'd found,</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>For it kept perfect time and it had
one desire</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>At the close of each day to be wound</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>At it kept to its place, not a frown
upon its face</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>At its hands never hung by its side</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>But it stopped, short, never to go
again</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>When the old man died</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>CHORUS</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>It rang an alarm in the still of the
night,</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>An alarm that for years had been dumb</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>And we knew that his spirit was pluming
for flight</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>That his hour of departure had come</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>Still the clock kept the time</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>With a soft and muffled chime</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>As we silently stood by his side</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>But it stopped, short, never to go
again</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>When the old man died</font></font>
