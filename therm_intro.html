  <li>The industrial revolution of the 18th and 19th centuries prompted
the need to understand the operation of the engines (primarily steam
powered) being developed to drive that revolution.&nbsp; The belief at
the time was that heat was a form of energy distinct from kinetic and
potential energies and that the operation of a steam engine somehow
converted heat energy into mechanical (kinetic and potential)
energy.&nbsp; With the
development of the atomic physics and quantum mechanics in the last
century we now know that heat is not a distinct form of energy, but can
be thought of as the mechanical energy of the
atoms and molecules of which matter is comprised.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><img style="width: 94px; height: 80px;" alt="fire animation"
 src="anim_fire.gif" align="right">The theory of heat developed in the
19th century involved
the <span style="font-style: italic;">macroscopic</span> properties of
materials (pressure, volume, temperature
etc.) and was called <span style="font-weight: bold;">THERMODYNAMICS</span>.&nbsp;
It was very successful in
speeding engine development and is essential in today's
society, where we obtain almost all of our energy via some sort of
combustion of fossil fuels in which heat is converted to mechanical
work (energy).</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>As indcated above Thermodynamics assumes no knowledge of the
detailed composition of materials.&nbsp; Nevertheless, with a knowledge
of the <span style="font-style: italic;">microscopic</span> properties
of materials (speeds, masses, momenta,
energies of the constituent atoms and molecules), it is possible
to create a theory of heat which uses this information and produces the
same results.&nbsp; This theory is called <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">STATISTICAL MECHANICS</span>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Thermodynamics and Statistical Mechanics are two distinct
theories for predicting the properites of systems where heat energy
is important.&nbsp; <span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Whichever theory is
applied the results obtained
will be the same.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>The time constraints of this course will limit our discussion
primarily to Thermodynamics.&nbsp; However, we may have cause to refer
to some of the results of statistical mechanics applied to gases known
as <a

THEORY</a>.<br>
